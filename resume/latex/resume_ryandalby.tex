  \begin{rSection}{Experience}

    \begin{rSubsection}{Amazon Web Services}{December 2024 - Present}{Software Dev Engineer II}{Seattle, Washington}
    \item Led application-level updates to support a major improvement to AWS Supply Chain onboarding experience, reducing the time for new customers to access the system from over 30 minutes to under 3 minutes.

    \end{rSubsection}

    \begin{rSubsection}{Amazon Web Services}{October 2022 - December 2024}{Software Dev Engineer}{Denver, Colorado and Seattle, Washington}
    \item Designed, built, and operated scalable AWS services, contributing end-to-end to core AWS Supply Chain systems, including launching new product features, public APIs, and operating a high availability AWS tier-1 service.
    \item Contributed to infrastructure and application development across multiple technologies, working with TypeScript-based AWS CDK for infrastructure, Kotlin/Java for application logic, and React for frontend components.
    \item Improved platform reliability and automation, streamlining deployments, enhancing security compliance, and optimizing system operations with limited resources.
    \item Contributed beyond core development by mentoring peers, providing architectural guidance, and actively supporting organization-wide initiatives.

    \end{rSubsection}

    \begin{rSubsection}{Seagate Technology}{June 2022 - August 2022}{Engineer II- Robotics Software}{Longmont, Colorado}
    \item Supported the C\#/.NET software of a robotic manufacturing tool.
    Used Hierarchical State Machine based software framework, finished backlog tasks, tested changes on hardware, and released software to production.
    \item Reduced unnecessary robotic teach-time by implementing a new recipe management system. Interfaced with various internal database systems with limited documentation by successfully networking across multiple teams. This reduced teach-time by up to 10 times per tool when a new product is introduced.
    \item Introduced modern version control practices to existing robotic software by making the software Git-friendly and implementing Gitflow to improve development speed and encourage collaboration. Added effective, previously non-existent documentation to assist future developers onboard for robotic tool development.
    \end{rSubsection}

    \begin{rSubsection}{Blyncsy Inc.}{Jan 2022 - May 2022}{Deep Learning Intern}{Salt Lake City, Utah}
    \item Developed a deep learning-based road crack detection pipeline for real-time geospatial mapping during a graduate internship, leveraging Python, computer vision, and state-of-the-art models. Earned a Graduate Certificate in Deep Learning from the University of Utah.
    \end{rSubsection}

    \begin{rSubsection}{Seagate Technology}{May 2020 - December 2020 and May 2021 - August 2021}{Summer Intern- Robotics Software Engineer}{Longmont, Colorado}
    \item Integrated production robotic tool software with a unifying C\#/.NET software system by porting robot I/O and kinematics, reducing operational and development burden. Developed machine learning models for defect detection and predictive maintenance, integrated ML.NET for model deployment, and facilitated global collaboration.
    \end{rSubsection}

    \begin{rSubsection}{Code Corporation}{May 2019 - August 2019}{Mechanical Engineer Intern}{Draper, Utah}
    \item Applied iterative engineering design using SOLIDWORKS and rapid prototyping to develop cost-efficient products, streamline manufacturing through engineering change orders, and enhance designs via product testing and agile project management.
