  \begin{rSection}{Experience}
  
    \begin{rSubsection}{Seagate Technology}{May 2021 - August 2021}{Robotics Software Engineer Intern}{Longmont, Colorado}
    \item Implemented new C\#/.NET software compatibility for a legacy tool by documenting and porting tool IO, implementing SCARA robot kinematics, and creating software to convert learned robot positions to be compatible with the new software. 
    Extensively documented porting process, tested software on hardware, and described a plan for replacing legacy software with new software. 
    \item Supported software of a tool throughout the summer. Completed high priority backlog items, tested on hardware, and released software to production, communicating with teams around the world.
    \item Investigated creating Cognex Vidi models for defect detection and OCR. Labeled data to train software and documented how to develop models.
    \end{rSubsection}
  
    \begin{rSubsection}{Seagate Technology}{May 2020 - December 2020}{Robotics Software Engineer Intern}{Longmont, Colorado}
    \item Leveraged machine learning to predict tool failures using regression, support vector machines, and recurrent convolutional neural networks implemented using Python and Keras. 
    \item Constructed a data wrangling pipeline to extract trainable features from raw log data. 
    \item Created ML.NET machine learning ONNX model consumption platform.
    \item Expanded team’s machine learning knowledge. Integrated machine software with a machine learning data platform using C\# and .NET.
    \item Reliably communicated with remote team members around the world.
    \end{rSubsection}

    \begin{rSubsection}{Code Corporation}{May 2019 - August 2019}{Mechanical Engineer Intern}{Draper, UT}
    \item Utilized the iterative engineering design process through SOLIDWORKS and rapid prototyping to develop an injection-molded bracket to combine multiple parts into a single new product.  
    \item Effectively made various changes to existing products through an engineering change order process to reduce manufacturing costs.  Assisted in conducting product testing to determine possible improvements.  
    \item Employed agile project management in a professional work environment to increase productivity and communication.
