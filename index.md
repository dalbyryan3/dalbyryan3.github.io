# Ryan Dalby
Hello!

I am a diversely skilled mechanical engineering and computer science student who is interested in applying data driven solutions to the interesting problems found in robotics, automation, image processing, and computer vision.

Currently I am a graduate student at the University of Utah.
I plan on graduating with an MS in Mechanical Engineering with a focus in robotics in spring 2022. 
I have strong computer science and data science skills which I have been able to progress during my graduate education.

Feel free to view my GitHub profile for a glimpse of some of the things I have worked on.
